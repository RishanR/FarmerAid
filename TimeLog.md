All the repositories now use this NetworkMonitor to determine the source to contact for their GET queries. Also remove await() for write/update/modify queries in the repositories wherever possible, so that when the app is offline, to the user it seems like the changes took effect seamlessly. Ensure data correctness, specifically inventory, when multiple users (all offline) harvest and/or sell and then go online roughly around the same time. Note: A lot of the time put into this task is for testing. |
